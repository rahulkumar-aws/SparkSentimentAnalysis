##Spark Sentiment Analysis

This code base will demonstrate how to build basic sentiment analysis system with Apache Spark.

We will be doing data transformation using Scala and Apache Spark 2, 
and For the sentiments calculation, here we are using a dictionary called AFINN.

__AFINN is a dictionary which consists of 2500 words rated from +5 to -5 depending on their meaning.__

```scala
sbt run
```

**Output**

```text
